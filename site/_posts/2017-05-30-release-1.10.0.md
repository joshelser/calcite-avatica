Apache Calcite Avatica 1.10.0 adds support for JDBC Array data,
Docker, and JDK 9.

From this release onwards, Docker images for Avatica Server are
published to [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/).  These
make Avatica is [easier than ever to run](../docs/docker_images.md).

As the Calcite and Avatica projects become
[more separate](2016-03-03-separate-project.md),
it is the first release since Avatica's git repository
[separated from Calcite's repository](2017-03-31-new-avatica-repository.md).

Avatica now runs on JDK 9 (and continues to run on JDK 7 and 8).

Clients may now send and receive Array data via the JDBC API.
There are improvements to date/time support in
[DateTimeUtils]({{ site.apiRoot }}/org/apache/calcite/avatica/util/DateTimeUtils.html),
and over 20 [new features and bug fixes](../_docs/history.md).
